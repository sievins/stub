> Print formatted Bible passages

Print out Bible passages with custom line spacing so there is space to scribble all over the text and study it.

https://biblegateway.com is a brilliant tool but has some limitations. For example you cannot customise the line spacing. Also it uses different types of white space characters which can result in odd line breaks when copy/pasting the passage into a text editor.
